###I downvoted you because...

This website is designed to help people understand why you downvoted them.

Participation in a reputation-ranked online community comes with its ups and downs.  You post something and get upvoted when people like or agree with it--<i>and that's great!</i>.  You feel good about yourself and what you've done.  You've won.

*Unfortunately,* you may also be <b>downvoted</b> because someone didn't.

Maybe you're someone who got downvoted, and you're wondering why everybody hates you.  Or maybe you're the downvoter, and you want to let the person who you downvoted why you did it so that they can fix the problem.  This website is **built for you**.

The goal for IDownvotedYouBecause is to give people an **easy, productive and helpful** way to let someone know **what the problem was** that caused your downvote, **what they can do to fix it**, and **why you think they should do so**.  It gives people who are downvoted a simple way to learn why they are being downvoted, why the culture of the community sees their actions as reasons for a downvote, and with detailed steps on what they can do to turn that downvote into an upvote.

###How does this website work?

This website hosts one page per reason why you downvoted someone.  Each reason has its own URL in the format

> IDownvotedYouBecause.com/AShortDescriptionOfTheReason

When you wish to let someone know why you downvoted them and how they could improve, simply leave a link to the relevant page.

You can browse our current list of reasons, sorted by community, [here](AllTheReasons).  New pages are added all the time.  Can't find your specific reason?  Is it worth sharing with others?  Read below!
